# Monte-Carlo simulations for empirical power of path coefficients and indirect effect

## Introduction 
A PDF containing my master's thesis in experimental psychology has been 
uploaded to this repository (Vandermeulen et al., 2023). It delves into the impact of (multi)collinearity 
on the empirical power of path coefficients within a serial mediation model. 
Utilizing a simulation approach, I investigated these effects, developing a
user-defined function to facilitate the process. Additionally, the thesis 
elucidates the circumstances under which empirical power diminishes in a 
(multi)collinear setting. Furthermore, it compares the Monte Carlo approach 
to classical power calculations, specifically Sobel's method, albeit this 
section has been omitted from the function.

The model is as follows: 

```{r, out.width="50%", echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/samvd/Desktop/MASTERPROEF/masterproef 2/plots/statistical model serial mediation/Dia1.JPG")
```

### On the function
The user-defined function, power.simulation(), is tailored to assess the 
empirical power of path coefficients in a serial mediation model featuring two
mediators and no moderators, as outlined in the accompanying file. Serial
mediation is determined using Hayes' method, a regression-based technique that
dissects the mechanisms between independent and dependent variables. This 
method quantifies both direct and indirect effects through mediators, offering 
valuable insights into intricate causal relationships 
(Rijnhart et al., 2021; MacKinnon et al., 2019; Have & Joffe, 2010).

The function itself is straightforward; it generates data for each simulation 
iteration based on predefined values for path coefficients, intercepts, and 
residual standard deviation. A comprehensive explanation of the methodology is
provided within the thesis. Although the model tested in this instance 
features a binary independent variable, it can be effortlessly 
adjusted as needed.

## Code with annotations

To run this function successfully, it's essential to have several R packages
installed. These packages provide essential functionalities for data
manipulation and statistical analysis.

```{r upload packages, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("semTools", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
install.packages("MKpower", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
install.packages("lavaan", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
```

```{r library packages, eval=FALSE}
library(lavaan); library(semTools);library(MKpower)
```

In this code snippet, variables for path coefficients, intercepts, residual 
standard deviation, sample size, and the likelihood of being female (1) are 
initialized. These variables will be exchanged with numeric values obtained
from data. Additionally, the number of simulations (NumSim) is set to 1000,
although this value must be adjusted to reduce Monte-Carlo error. The comment
provides an example of how to assign numeric values to the path coefficients 
variable (b_2). This code serves as a foundation for conducting simulations
and analyses related to a serial mediation model in experimental psychology.

```{r intialize values, eval=FALSE}
# numeric values should be filled in between parentheses
# path coefficients 
a_1 <- c(); a_2 <- c(); c_prime <- c()
d <- c(); b_1 <- c(); b_2 <- c()
# intercepts 
i1 <- c(); i2 <- c(); i3 <- c()
# residual standard deviation 
sigma_m1 <- c(); sigma_m2 <- c(); sigma_m3 <- c()
# sample size
n <- c()
# chance of being female (1)
k <- c()
# number of simulations
NumSim   <-  c()
````

This function is flexible and adaptable, capable of accommodating both single 
and multiple simulation scenarios. For a specific simulation scenario, users 
can obtain numeric values for particular path coefficients, intercepts, 
residual standard deviation, sample size,... 

Additionally, by utilizing the expand.grid() function, a data frame can be 
generated containing a row for each combination of the supplied factors. 
A factor here is a numeric vector for e.g.: path coefficient, intercept,...
this vector allow us to research increasing collinearity between predictors. 
This versatility empowers researchers to investigate a wide range of 
experimental conditions and hypotheses within their serial mediation models.

```{r make data frame with simulation scenarios, eval=FALSE}
# make a grid with a row for every possible simulation scenario. 
grid <- data.frame(expand.grid(a_1, a_2, c_prime, d, b_1, b_2, i1, i2,
                               i3, sigma_m1, sigma_m2, sigma_m3))
# name grid columns
colnames(grid) <- c("a_1", "a_2", "c_prime", "d", "b_1",
                    "b_2", "i1", "i2", "i3", "sigma_m1", 
                    "sigma_m2", "sigma_m3")  
```                    

Now that a data frame has been constructed with all the necessary simulation 
scenarios, is it time to initialize the function.

The functions arguments are the parameters that were used to make the grid,
plus "n", "k" and "NumSim". Keep in mind that the serial mediation model used 
here had a binary independent variable ("sex"). Future researchers can change 
this in their code and possibly leave the "k" parameter out of the arguments. 
                    
```{r initialize function, eval=FALSE}
# define function power.simulation(arguments)
power.simulation <- function(a_1, a_2, c_prime, d, b_1,
                             b_2, i1, i2, i3, sigma_m1, sigma_m2,
                             sigma_m3, n, k, NumSim)
{  
  # Monte-Carlo simulation of power of coefficients and indirect effect
  pval.a_1     <- rep(NA, NumSim); pval.a_2     <- rep(NA, NumSim)
  pval.d       <- rep(NA, NumSim); pval.b_1     <- rep(NA, NumSim)
  pval.b_2     <- rep(NA, NumSim); pval.c_prime <- rep(NA, NumSim)
  intdes <- matrix(0, NumSim, 2)
  indicatorIE <- vector("numeric", NumSim)
  # start loop (empirical power via MC simulations)
  for(i in 1:NumSim)
  {
   set.seed(i)
    # create first binary predictor (Sex)
    df$X <- data.frame(rbinom(n, 1, k)
    # create data   
    df$M_1 <- i1 + a_1*df$X + rnorm(n, 0, sigma_m1)
    df$M_2 <- i2 + a_2*df$X +       d*df$M_1 + rnorm(n, 0, sigma_m2)
    df$Y   <- i3 + c_prime*df$X + b_1*df$M_1 + b_2*df$M_2 + rnorm(n, 0, sigma_m3)   
    colnames(df) <- c("X", "M_1", "M_2", 'Y')
    # fit linear regression models on the simulated data 
    fit.1 <- lm(df$M_1 ~ df$X)
    fit.2 <- lm(df$M_2 ~ df$X + df$M_1)
    fit.3 <- lm(df$Y ~ df$X + df$M_1 + df$M_2)
    # MC Confidence Interval for the indirect effect through both mediators
    model <- "
      M_1 ~ a1*X
      M_2 ~ a2*X + d21*M_1
      Y ~ cp*X + b1*M_1 + b2*M_2
      ind_eff := a1*d21*b2
      "
    fit <- sem(model = model, data = df) 
    # extract the upper and lower bound 
    intdes[i,1] <- monteCarloCI(fit)[1,2]
    intdes[i,2] <- monteCarloCI(fit)[1,3]
    # indicator function 
    indicatorIE[i] <- ifelse(((intdes[i,1] < 0) & (intdes[i,2] > 0)),0,1)
    # save p-values
    pval.a_1[i] <- coef(summary(fit.1))[2,4] 
    pval.a_2[i] <- coef(summary(fit.2))[2,4]
    pval.d[i] <- coef(summary(fit.2))[3,4]
    pval.b_1[i] <- coef(summary(fit.3))[3,4]
    pval.b_2[i] <- coef(summary(fit.3))[4,4]
    pval.c_prime[i] <- coef(summary(fit.3))[2,4]
  }
  # store power for MC 
  power.a_1 <- mean(pval.a_1 < 0.05); power.a_2  <- mean(pval.a_2 < 0.05)
  power.b_1 <- mean(pval.b_1 < 0.05); power.b_2 <- mean(pval.b_2 < 0.05)
  power.d <- mean(pval.d < 0.05); power.c_prime <- mean(pval.c_prime < 0.05)
  power.IE <- mean(indicatorIE) 
  # list results. Listing is done for later graphing using GGPlot2
  results <- list("power.a_1" = power.a_1, "power.a_2" = power.a_2,
                  "power.b_1" = power.b_1, "power.b_2" = power.b_2, 
                  "power.d" = power.d, "power.c_prime" = power.c_prime, 
                  "power.IE" = power.IE) 
  return(results)
}   
```

Now that the function is initialized, it becomes possible to apply it across 
all rows within the data frame capturing the simulation scenarios. Each row 
corresponds to a distinct simulation scenario, facilitating comprehensive 
exploration and analysis.

```{r run function for every simulation scenario, eval=FALSE}
results.power <- pbapply::pbmapply(power.simulation, a_1 = grid$a_1, a_2 = grid$a_2,
                                   c_prime = grid$c_prime, d = grid$d, b_1 = grid$b_1, 
                                   b_2 = grid$b_2, i1 = grid$i1, i2 = grid$i2, i3 = grid$i3, 
                                   sigma_m1 = grid$sigma_m1, sigma_m2 = grid$sigma_m2, 
                                   sigma_m3 = grid$sigma_m3)
```
         
The following code unlists the compiled results for each simulation scenario,
showcasing the empirical power per path coefficient and indirect effect.
After unlisting, the grid can be used to make graphs using i.e. GGPlot2.  
         
```{r unlist results, eval=FALSE}                                   
# unlist
grid$power.a_1      <- unlist(results.power[seq(1, length(results.power), 7)])
grid$power.a_2      <- unlist(results.power[seq(2, length(results.power), 7)])
grid$power.b_1      <- unlist(results.power[seq(3, length(results.power), 7)]) 
grid$power.b_2      <- unlist(results.power[seq(4, length(results.power), 7)]) 
grid$power.d        <- unlist(results.power[seq(5, length(results.power), 7)])
grid$power.c_prime  <- unlist(results.power[seq(6, length(results.power), 7)])
grid$power.IE       <- unlist(results.power[seq(7, length(results.power), 7)])
```
